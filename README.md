# Water-potability-prediction-
This work uses over 3500 water samples from a variety of water sources including surface water and subsurface (boreholes) samples to predict water potability. It considers potable water as water that is safe to drink and free from contaminants, harmful bacteria, microorganisms, toxic chemicals, viruses, and fecal matter. It comes from surface and ground sources and is treated to levels that meet state and federal standards for consumption.

 From the charts a relationship is seen to exist between ph and salinity and ph and conductivity. A relationship is observed between chloramines and interactions.

 The ph of the water samples are seen to increase in relation to salinity and conductivity. The same can be said of the relationship between interactions and chloramines.
